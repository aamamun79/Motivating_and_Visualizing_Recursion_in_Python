# Motivating and Visualizing Recursion in Python

A riff on [Gustavo Duarte](https://github.com/gduarte)'s blog post about [using better motivated examples to visualize recursion](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/recursion/).

This IPython Notebook uses the same example - traversing a maze (representing as a binary tree) - and contrasts it with the recursive and iterative versions of factorial. The main difference is that it is done here in Python, whereas the original version is in C.
